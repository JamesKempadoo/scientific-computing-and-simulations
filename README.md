# scientific-computing-and-simulations

Project worked on within university where I worked on simulation with multi-threading to make different simulations more efficient and giving how they are effected by the number of threads and other forms of manipulation. There is a pdf of the work if you wanted to have a reference of all the work that was done over the module.
